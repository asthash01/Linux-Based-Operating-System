CHAPTER 1INTRODUCTION
One important reason for LFS's existence is to help people learn how a Linux system works from the inside out. One of the best things that this learning experience provides is the ability to customize Linux to your own tastes and needs.

A key benefit of LFS is that it allows users to have more control over the system without relying on someone else's Linux implementation.

Another benefit of LFS is the ability to create a very compact Linux system. When installing a regular distribution, one is often forced to include several programs which are probably never used. These programs waste disk space, or worse, CPU cycles.

An additional advantage of a custom built Linux system is security. By compiling the entire system from source code, you are empowered to audit everything and apply all the security patches desired. The goal of Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and usable foundation-level system.
 
CHAPTER 2 MODULES

The LFS system will be built by using a previously installed Linux distribution (such as Debian, Mandriva, Red Hat. or SUSE). This existing Linux system (the host) will be used as a starting point to provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker, and shell, to build the new system. Our LFS system has five modules. They are

>	Create a new Linux native partition and file system.
y	Download the packages and patches.
>	Constructing a temporary system.
>	Constructing a LFS system.
>	Making LFS system bootable.

2.1: CREATE A NEW LINUX NATIVE PARTITION AND FILE SYSTEM.

In this step, the partition which will host the LFS system is prepared. We will create the partition itself, create a file system on it, and mount it.

2.1.1. Creating a New Partition

Like most other operating systems, LFS is usually installed on a dedicated partition. The recommended approach to building an LFS system is to use an available empty partition. A minimal system requires a partition of around 1.3 gigabytes (GB). This is enough to store all the source tarballs and compile the packages. However, if the LFS system is intended to be the primary Linux system, additional software will probably be installed which will require additional space (2-3 GB). it is a good idea to use a small disk partition as swap space. This is used by the kernel to store seldom-used data and leave more memory available for active processes.
2.1.2.	Creating a File System on the Partition

Now that a blank partition has been set up, the file system can be created. The most widely-used system in the Linux world is the second extended file system (ext2), but with newer high-capacity hard disks, journaling file systems are becoming increasingly popular.

2.1.3.	Mounting the New Partition

Now that a file system has been created, the partition needs to be made accessible. In order to do this, the partition needs to be mounted at a chosen mount point.
Choose a mount point and assign it to the LFS environment variable by running:
export LFS=/mnt/lfs
Next, create the mount point and mount the LFS file system by running: mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext3 /dev/<xxr> $LFS
Replace <xxx> with the designation of the LFS partition.
2.2:DOWNLOAD THE PACKAGES AND PATCHES.
Downloaded packages and patches will need to be stored somewhere that is conveniently available throughout the entire build. A working directory is also required to unpack the sources and build them. $LFS/sources can be used both as the place to store the tarballs and patches and as a working directory. By using this directory, the required elements will be located on the LFS partition and will be available during all stages of the building process.

To create this directory, execute the following command, as user root, before starting the download session: mkdir -v $LFS/sources

2.2.1	Creating the $LFS/tools Directory

All programs compiled in this step will be installed under $LFS/tools to keep them separate from the programs compiled in next step.Programs compiled here are temporary tools and will not be a part of the final LFS system. By keeping these programs in a separate directory, they can easily be discarded later after their use.

Create the required directory by running the following as root:

mkdir -v $LFS/tools

The next step is to create a /tools symlink on the host system. This will point to the newly-created directory on the LFS partition. Run this command as root as well:

In -sv $LFS/tools /



2.2.2	Adding the LFS User

When logged in as user root, making a single mistake can damage or destroy a system. Therefore, we recommend building the packages in this chapter as an unprivileged user.

Grant lfs full access to $LFS/tools by making lfs the directory owner:.If a separate working directory was created as suggested, give user lfs ownership of this directory:

2.2.3	Toolchain

The overall goal of this step is to provide a temporary environment that can be chrooted into and from which can be produced a clean, trouble-free build of the target LFS system.Various packages to be installed are:

f.3: CONSTRUCTING TEMPORARY LFS SYSTEM.

2.3.1 Preparing Virtual Kernel File Systems

Various file systems exported by the kernel are used to communicate to and from the kernel itself. These file systems are virtual in that no disk space is used for them. The content of the file systems resides in memory.

2.3.2. Creating Initial Device Nodes

When the kernel boots the system, it requires the presence of a few device nodes, in particular the console and null devices. The device nodes will be created on the hard disk so that they are available before udevd has been started, and additionally when Linux is started with init-/bin/bash.
 

2.3.3 Mounting and Populating /dev

The recommended method of populating the /dev directory with devices is to mount a virtual filesystem (such as tmpfs) on the /dev directory, and allow the devices to mt created dynamically on that virtual filesystem as they are detected or accessed. This is generally done during the boot process by Udev.
2.3.4. Mounting Virtual Kernel File Systems
Now mount the remaining virtual kernel filesystems:
2.3.5	Entering the Chroot Environment
Enter the chroot environment to begin building and installing the final LFS
system.

2.3.6	Creating Directoriesa

It is time to create some structure in the LFS file system. Create a standard directory tree.

2.3.7	Creating Essential Files and Symlinks

Some programs use hard-wired paths to programs which do not exist yet. In order to satisfy these programs, create a number of symbolic links which will be replaced by real files after the software has been installed:

A proper Linux system maintains a list of the mounted file systems in the file /etc/mtab. Normally, this file would be created when we mount a new file system. Since we will not be mounting any file systems inside our chroot environment, create an empty file for utilities that expect the presence of /etc/mtab:

In order for user root to be able to login and for the name "root" to be recognized, there must be relevant entries in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.
2.4: CONSTRUCTING A LFS SYSTEM.

To finish the installation, the LFS-Bootscripts and the kernel and boot loader are set up in this chapter. This chapter details how to install and configure the LFS-Bootscripts package.

LFS-Bootscripts-6.3:
The LFS-Bootscripts package contains a set of scripts to start/stop the LFS system at bootup/shutdown.
2.5.1 Installation of LFS-Bootscripts

Install the package:

make install '

Contents of LFS-Bootscripts
Installed scripts: checkfs, cleanfs, console, consolelog, functions, halt, ifdown, ifup, localnet, modules, mountfs, mountkernfs, network, rc, reboot, sendsignals, setclock, static, swap, sysctl, sysklogd, template, udev, and udev_retry

2.5.2 How Do These Bootscripts Work?

Linux uses a special booting facility named SysVinit that is based on a concept of run-levels. It can be quite different from one system to another, so it cannot be assumed that because things worked in one particular Linux distribution, they should work the same in LFS too. LFS has its own way of doing things, but it respects generally accepted standards.

SysVinit (which will be referred to as "init" from now on) works using a run-levels scheme. There are seven (numbered 0 to 6) run-levels (actually, there are more run-levels, but they are for special cases and are generally not used. See init(8) for more details), and each one of those corresponds to the actions the computer is supposed to perform when it starts up. The default run-level is 3. Here are the descriptions of the different run-levels as they are implemented:

0: halt the computer 1: single-user mode
2: multi-user mode without networking
3: multi-user mode with networking
4: reserved for customization, otherwise does the same as 3
5: same as 4,it is usually used for GUI login(like X's xdm or KDE's kdm)
6: reboot the computer

The command used to change run-levels is init <runlevel>, where <nmlevel> is the target run-level. For example, to reboot the computer, a user could issue the init 6 command, which is an alias for the reboot command. Likewise, init 0 is an alias for the halt command.

There are a number of directories under /etc/red that look like rc?.d (where ? is the number of the run-level) and rcsysinit.d, all containing a number of symbolic links. Some begin with a K, the others begin with an S, and all of them have two numbers following the initial letter. The K means to stop (kill) a service and the S means to start a service. The numbers determine the order in which the scripts are run, from 00 to 99—the lower the number the earlier it gets executed. When init switches to another run-level, the appropriate services are either started or stopped, depending on the runlevel chosen.
The real scripts are in /etc/rc.d/init.d. They do the actual work, and the symlinks all point to them. Killing links and starting links point to the same script in /etc/rc.d/init.d. This is because the scripts can be called with different parameters like start, stop, restart, reload, and status. When a K link is encountered, the appropriate script is run with the stop argument. When an S link is encountered, the appropriate script is run with the start argument.

There is one exception to this explanation. Links that start with an 5 in the rcO.d and rc6.d directories will not cause anything to be started. They will be called with the parameter stop to stop something. The logic behind this is that when a user is going to reboot or halt the system, nothing needs to be started. The system only needs to be stopped.

These are descriptions of what the arguments make the scripts do:

start
The service is started.
stop
The service is stopped.
restart
The service is stopped and then started again.
reload
The configuration of the service is updated. This is used after the configuration file of a service was modified, when the service does not need to be restarted.
status
Tells if the service is running and with which PIDs.

Feel free to modify the way the boot process works (after all, it is your own LFS system). The files given here are an example of how it can be done.
2.5.3	Configuring the setclock Script

The setclock script reads the time from the hardware clock, also known as the BIOS or the Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) clock. If the hardware clock is set to UTC, this script will convert the hardware clock's time to the local time using the /etc/localtime file (which tells the hwclock program which timezone the user is in). There is no way to detect whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC, so this needs to be configured manually.

2.5.4	Configuring the Linux Console

This section discusses how to configure the console and consolelog bootscripts that set up the keyboard map, console font and console kernel log level. If non-ASCII characters (e.g., the copyright sign, the British pound sign and Euro symbol) will not be used and the keyboard is a U.S. one, much of this section can be skipped. Without the configuration file, the console bootscript will do nothing.

2.5.5	Creating the /etc/inputrc File

The inputrc file handles keyboard mapping for specific situations. This file is the startup file used by Readline — the input-related library — used by Bash and most other shells.

2.5.6	The Bash Shell Startup Files

The shell program /bin/bash (hereafter referred to as "the shell") uses a collection of startup files to help create an environment to run in. Each file has a specific use and may affect login and interactive environments differently. The files in the /etc directory provide global settings. If an equivalent file exists in the home directory, it may override the global settings.
2.5.7 Configuring the localnet Script

Part of the job of the localnet script is setting the system's hostname. This needs to be configured in the /etc/sysconfig/network file.

2.5.8 Customizing the /etc/hosts File

If a network card is to be configured, decide on the IP address, fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), and possible aliases for use in the /etc/hosts file.

2.6:MAKING THE LFS SYSTEM BOOTABLE

2.6.1	Creating the /etc/fstab File

The /etc/fstab file is used by some programs to determine where file systems are to be mounted by default, in which order, and which must be checked (for integrity errors) prior to mounting.
2.6.2	Linux-2.6.22.5
The Linux package contains the Linux kernel.
Installation of the kernel
Building the kernel involves a few steps—configuration, compilation, and installation. Read the README file in the kernel source tree for alternative methods to the way this book configures the kernel.

2.6.3	Making the LFS System Bootable

Boot loading can be a complex area, so a few cautionary words are in order. Be familiar with the current boot loader and any other operating systems present on the hard drive(s) that need to be bootable. GRUB uses its own naming structure for drives and partitions in the form of (hdn,m), where n is the hard drive number and m is the partition number, both starting from zero. For example, partition hdal is (hdO,0) to GRUB and
 
hdb3 is (lull,2). In contrast to Linux, GRUB does not consider CD-ROM drives to be hard drives. For example, if using a CD on hdb and a second hard drive on hdc, that second hard drive would still be (lull).

2.6.4 Rebooting the System

Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot your computer. Now that we have said that, lets move on to booting our shiny new LFS installation for the first time! First exit from the chroot environment.Then unmount the virtual files systems. Unmount the LFS file system itself. Now, reboot the system.
 
System study is the first stage of system development life cycle..System study aims at establishing request for the system to be acquired,developed and installed.lt involves studying and analyzing the ways of an organization currently processing the data to produce information.Analyzing the problem thoroughly forms the vital part of the system study.In system analysis,prevailing situation of problem is carefully examined by breaking them into subproblems.Problematic areas are identified and information is collected.Data gathering is essential to any analyzis of request.lt is necessary that this analyzis familiarizez the designer with objectives,activities and the function of the organization in which system is to be implemented.

3.1	STUDY OF EXISTING SYSTEM
When you install a regular distribution, you often end up installing a lot of programs that you would probably never use.Linux is not a customized system according to the user's tastes and needs. It take a lot of disk space for storage, also security of linux is restricted in some means

3.2	STUDY OF PROPOSED SYSTEM
There are several benefits of building LFS
>	Building LFS produces a very compact Linux system
>	LFS is extremely flexible
You have the ability to turn it into whatever type of system you need it to be, customized completely for you.
>	LFS offers you added security
LFS system is compiled from source, thus allowing us to audit everything, if we wish to do so, and apply all the security patches we want or need to apply.
The second phase in system development cycle is system analysis. Analysis involved a detailed study of the current system, leading to specifications of a new system. Analysis is a detailed study of various operations performed by a system and their relationships within and outside the system.

System Analysis also includes sub-dividing of complex process involving the entire system, identification of data store and manual processes.

The main points to be discussed in system analysis are:
•	Specification of what the new system is to accomplish based on the user requirements.
•	Functional hierarchy showing the functions to be performed by the new system and their relationship with each other.
•	Function network which are similar to function hierarchy but they highlight the those functions which are common to more than one procedure.
 
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: Processor : PENTIUM IV Ram       :512 MB RAM Hard Disk : 80 GB Hard disk




SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

Operating System     : Linux
 
Based on the user requirements and the detailed analysis of a new system, the new system must be designed. This is the phase of system designing. It is a most crucial phase in the development of a system. Normally, the design proceeds in two stages :
•	preliminary or general design
•	Structure or detailed design

Preliminary or general design: In the preliminary or general design, the features of the new system are specified. The costs of implementing these features and the benefits to be derived are estimated. If the project is still considered to be feasible, we move to the detailed design stage.

Structure or Detailed design: In the detailed design stage, computer oriented work begins in earnest. At this stage, the design of the system becomes more structured. Structure design is a blue print of a computer system solution to a given problem having the same components and inter-relationship among the same components as the original problem. Input, output and processing specifications are drawn up in detail. In the design stage, the programming language and the platform in which the new system will run are also decided.
After designing the new system, the whole system is required to be converted into computer understanding language. Coding the new system into computer programming language does this. It is an important stage where the defined procedure are transformed into control specifications by the help of a computer language. This is also called the programming phase in which the programmer converts the program specifications into computer instructions, which we refer as programs. The programs coordinate the data movements and control the entire process in a system.

In our project we deals with making a new operating system from an existing one. Instead Of coding here we install various kind of packages using some built in commands using the existing system. These packages are given in tarball format. The procedure used to deal with these packages are
>	Untar
>	Configure
>	Compilation
>	Installation
Before actually implementing the new system into operations, a test run of the system is done removing all the bugs, if any. It is an important phase of a successful system. After codifying the whole programs of the system, a test plan should be developed and run on a given set of test data. The output of the test run should match the expected results.

Using the test data following test run are carried out:
•	Unit test
•	System test

Unit test: When the programs have been coded and compiled and brought to working conditions, they must be individually tested with the prepared test data. Any undesirable happening must be noted and debugged (error corrections).

System Test: After carrying out the unit test for each of the programs of the system and when errors are removed, then system test is done. At this stage the test is done on actual data. The complete system is executed on the actual data. At each stage of the execution, the results or output of the system is analysed. During the result analysis, it may be found that the outputs are not matching the expected out of the system. In such case, the errors in the particular programs are identified and are fixed and further tested for the expected output.
 

The Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a compact, flexible Linux system. LFS also provides more security features and consume less space compared to existing Linux system.

We have succeeded in developing the LFS system using all phases of software development cycle. We are also succeeded in building an error free and efficient LFS system within the given time limit. There is also provision for future developments in the system.
The current system developed is in accordance with the taste and needs of a user. On regarding the future enhancement the system can further expanded in accordance with the changing scenario. Since the change in testing and user needs arises frequently in certain short intervals of time, the system can be further upgraded to meet the requirements that may arise in the far or near future. With regarding to the needs that arises ,more and more features can be included by adding it as separate modules and integrate it with the existing system .
